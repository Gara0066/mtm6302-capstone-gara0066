For the Pokedex design I try to use a similar color pallete already used in Pokemon.
The main colors chosen are:
`#FFFFFF`
`#FFCC00`
`#0075BE`
`#061634`
`#FB1B1B`
`#000000`
`#D4D4D4`
The previous colors will be used throughout the entire web app from the header, to each pokemon card. 
And I wanted to have an additional bivrant color pallette used for the statistics of each pokemon.
This secondary color pallette is composed by:
`#00578D`
`#6B008A`
`#79BE00`
`#E4EC06`
`#E0054E`
`#E4A002`
The font used is Century Gothic.
The branding for this pokedex is in accordance with the olready stablished POKEMON Brand. Using the 
same logo for continuity.
It will be an easy to use pokedex with a button shaped like a pokeball that allows the user to catch their
favorite pokemons.
