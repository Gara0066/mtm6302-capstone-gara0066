For the Pokedex design I try to use a similar color pallete already used in Pokemon.
The main colors chosen are:
`#FFFFFF`
`#FFCC00`
`#0075BE`
`#061634`
`#FB1B1B`
`#000000`
`#D4D4D4`
The previous colors will be used throughout the entire web app from the header, to each pokemon card. 
And I wanted to have an additional bivrant color pallette used for the statistics of each pokemon.
This secondary color pallette is composed by:
`#00578D`
`#6B008A`
`#79BE00`
`#E4EC06`
`#E0054E`
`#E4A002`
The font used is Century Gothic.
The branding for this pokedex is in accordance with the olready stablished POKEMON Brand. Using the 
same logo for continuity.
It will be an easy to use pokedex with a button shaped like a pokeball that allows the user to catch their
favorite pokemons.

The first step in creating a Pokedex prototype was to plan and design the layout of the page. I decided to create a simple design with a search bar, a list of Pokemon, and a section for displaying information about a selected Pokemon. I started coding the HTML markup for the Pokedex prototype, added a search bar using the input tag and a list of Pokemon (added the pokemon card design but will retrieve the list of pokemon using POKEAPI).Another html was created to display the pokemon information.
Challenges that I have creating this project are:
1. Struggling in creating a seamless responsive design.(At some point breaks, the layout get lost)
2. I was unable to change direction of progress to place them side by side in a vertical position.
3. Unable to change the color of progress bar.
4. I will verify if the progress bar option is covenient for this prototype, otherwise I will try to change the display with Javascript.
